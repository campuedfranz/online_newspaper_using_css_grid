                    Out of the current Four Emperors, Shanks is the oldest one, having risen to the position 6 years prior to the current events of the story. 
                    Four years before Luffy set off on his journey, Shanks became a Yonko somehow, despite having lost his apparently dominant arm. As such, 
                    he has the highest active bounty from the current Yonko which amounts to 4, 089,100,00 berries. Shanks is an incredibly powerful pirate 
                    and his crew, the Red Hair Pirates, are known to be the most balanced pirate crew with no known weaknesses. All of his Officers are said 
                    to be quite strong, making him the most balanced crew out of the Four Emperors. Blackbeard, on the other hand, rose to this

                    position after the Payback War against Whitebeard Pirates during the two-year timeskip. 
                    After crushing them and claiming all their territory, Blackbeard was finally given this position. Having killed Whitebeard, stolen his Devil Fruit, and then acquired all his territories and his allies, 
                    he solidified himself as one of the strongest people on the seas and gained a bounty of 2.246 billion berries.  The newest additions to the ranks 
                    of the Yonko are Monkey D. Luffy and Buggy. Fans have followed Luffy's journey from the very beginning of the story and over the years, 
                    he's become an incredibly powerful pirate. Following the two-year timeskip, Luffy's strength rose to a

                    whole new level, and he became powerful enough to challenge the likes of the Yonko.  In the Wano Country arc, he gained mastery over his Conqueror's Haki 
                    and awakened his legendary Devil Fruit, called Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika. With these powers, he defeated Yonko Kaido and thus took his position 
                    as one of the Emperors of the Sea. Buggy, on the other hand, is a rather interesting addition to their ranks. While on paper, he is quite weak and 
                    couldn't possibly even stand up to a mere Yonko Commander, he has terrific influence in the world. Not only is Buggy a former member of the Roger Pirates, but he's also a sworn brother of Yonko Shanks. At the same time,

                    he has a great monopoly over the underworld and his allies even included the Giants of Elbaf until recently. As such Buggy's addition 
                    to the ranks of the Yonko is completely justified, however, his current bounty isn't known.
